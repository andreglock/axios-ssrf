# Get Started
- run `pnpm install` on the root, backend, and frontend directories
- run `pnpm start:dev` on the root directory

## Vulnerabilities
### Server Side Request Forgery:
I specifically used a version of axios that is vulnerable to SSRF attacks.
- Go to the search bar and type an absolute URL like `http://example.com`

### Path Traversal:
The downloads middleware is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. Because this is not a conventional controller this can't be detected by the SAST tools (semgrep and checkmarx).
